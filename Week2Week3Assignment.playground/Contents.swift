//PROBLEM 1:
// Week 2 problem
// Fizz Buzz:
// with if/else statements and with switch statement
// given a number, if the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
// if the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
// if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
// otherwise, print the number

// week 3 problem:
// FizzBuzz part 2:
// write a function that takes an array of numbers and prints fizzbuzz for that array


// PROBLEM 2:
// week 2 problem:
let string = "B0b has a typo problem."
// expectedOutput = 1

// Tell me what the index is of the first numeric character is. Your solution should work for any string. Give me the index in the form of an integer.

// Week 3 problem
// Give me the the String.Index as a result of using the firstIndex(where:) method.


// PROBLEM 3:
// week 2 problem:

let string2 = "Nathen is Cool"

//let expectedOutput = "NIC"

// give me the first letter of each word in the sentence back in a single string, with all the letters capitalized, with no spaces in th resulting string.

// week 3 problem:

// write a function that will take a 2D array of strings and return a 2d array of strings.
// input example: ["Nathen is Cool", "Amanda is kinda weird"]
// expected output: ["NIC", "AIKW"]
